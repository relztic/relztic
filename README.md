👾 I'm a Full-Stack Wizard with extensive experience in the field since 2014—most recently in the Health Tech market,  
where I've gained deep understanding of industry-specific requirements. Over the years, I have worked on both  
back-end and front-end, tailoring my approach to make use of my expertise which goes from high-integrity data  
migrations to building user-centric web applications.

⚡️ Whether I'm refactoring a legacy codebase or architecting a new system from scratch, I focus on building scalable  
solutions that meet specific client needs without sacrificing performance.

🌱 When I'm not in front of a screen, I love to take care of my 5 cats (RIP Sylvester), water my plants, bake delicious  
desserts (ask for my coconut flan recipe), play retro games on my CRT TV, and restore my BMW E92 M3.

✌🏾 I'm always open to discussing new challenges and high-impact opportunities.
